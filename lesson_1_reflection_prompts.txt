How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Immediately highlighted changes in file making it super easy to find bugs introduced by the changes.
    

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Can use diff to easily find bugs introduced by changes
    Get complete history of when each specific change was made to a program
    Easy to rollback features if don't like the result of changes made


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    PROS:
    	- Each commit makes logical sense as a unit (not random)
    	- Provides meaningful development history
    CONS:
        - Can lose work if forget to save and your editor doesn't autosave


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    For systems like coding where can have multiple related files, committing
    multiple files makes sense.  For systems where docs are NOT related you
    do not need to commit multiple files.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Using git log you can view the entire history of the project.  Each entry
    has a description of the change made.  git diff allows you to view the specific changes made in each commit by viewing the differences between it and the previous commit.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    As long as you have a version in your repository that works, you can 
    confidently proceed since any bugs you introduce can be removed by going
    back to a previous version or by using diff to find the specific lines
    of code that introduced the bug.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I need to use it for the Android Development course in Udacity.  I also
    plan on using it for all software development going forward.
