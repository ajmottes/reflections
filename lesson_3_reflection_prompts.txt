When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would want to use a remote repository when: (1) I was working on a project
    using more than one machine; (2) I was working on a project with other people
    who would be contributing to the project; or (3) I wanted to share my code
    with other people as an open-source project.
